To use the code, please clone or download the entire project, then open the `incomplete-linking.Rproj` file in [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).  The "code" folder contains the necessary scripts to replicate all results, annotated *reasonably* well by author Jacob Lahne.  You will require a recent version of [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/) (> version 4.0) and the aforementioned RStudio IDE to use the `incomplete-linking.Rproj` file.  You will also be prompted to install a number of packages if you do not typically use them in order to execute the scripts.

If you have issues using this code, you can email `jlahne at vt dot edu` with questions.
